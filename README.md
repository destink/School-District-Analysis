# School_District_Analysis
## Overview
The main objective of the school district analysis was to reimport the data set that contained new and updated information and to perform an analysis on several components for the school district. 

## Analysis
There three main observations made through the comparison between district and charter schools:
1. Is that overall reading scores are essentially the same between the two and charter schools only have better math scores by four points. 
2. Public schools in this district have approximately $40K more budgeting to allocate to their schools.
3. The average grades are higher in charter schools for grades 9-11 but the grades of seniors significantly drop off and are lower than the grades of seniors in publics schools.

## Summary
Additional analysis could be performed to look at each public and charter school in the district more in depth to see if the amount of budget spent by each school equates to the students overall GPA increasing compared to other similar schools.
